# JavaScript Mastery Notes

Interactive JavaScript notes - topics from basics to advanced, explained clearly with **runnable Monaco editor** examples.  
I treat this as a living study notebook: fast to skim for revision, deep enough to learn properly.

## Why this exists

-   I wanted a **single place** to read short theory, see a **minimal example**, and **run it instantly** in the browser.
-   Focus is on **clarity, pitfalls, and patterns** I actually use.
-   Everything is built with **Vite + React + Monaco** for a smooth, VS Codeâ€“like editing experience.
