# Javascript Notes

## About

Concise, micro-topic notes on JavaScript—from fundamentals to internals—with a production-first mindset.
Each topic follows a tight structure (What/Why • Core Rules • Pitfalls • Checklist • See Also) for fast recall.
Ideal for code reviews, interviews, and daily engineering; growing into a searchable GitHub Pages site.
